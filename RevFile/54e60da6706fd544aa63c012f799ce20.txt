I think that the people in this situation are having a randle time. It's somewhat of a silly situation with someone upside down in a boat, and someone using a ruler as a surfboard. How awkward is it to see a cow floating in the ocean, or a fish blowing a trumpet in the ear of someone? This is quite absurd to see someone driving a car in the middle of the ocean, and have a puppy dog with a floaty. Also, it's quite odd to see someone eating an ice cream cone with the pointy upside down.
