This is a very fun, sunny, beach day. Everyone is having fun and, despite the craziness of the entire situation, everyone seems to be minding their own business and not questioning the impossibility of some of these events happening around them. I'm seeing everyone is just, um, carefree, pretty much enjoying their life and enjoying seeing everyone else enjoying their lives.
