So, we have a nice, uh, colorful picture of a beach, very crowded beach. Um, everybody seems to be having a good time. This looks like it is something, uh, kinda picture, um, that you're supposed to see what's wrong, like, the weird things in the picture. So, there's a lotta weird stuff going on here. There's a sailboat that's upside down in the ocean. Uh, there's a guy riding a ruler. Uh, there's a cow in the water. There's a stop sign on the beach.
Um, the lifeguard has snowshoes on, and there's a fork next to him. One of the legs of the lifeguard tower is a fork. Um, there's a crab on stilts. There's a lady whose flip-flop is upside down on her foot. Got a kid carrying an upside down ice cream cone. And there's a fish playing a trumpet. There's also a car in the water, and there's a bird wearing shorts on top of that car. 
Uh, those are all the weird things I've noticed. I'm sure there's more, but, yeah, it's a lotta weird stuff. Ooh, that looks like a fun little picture. Um, yeah.
