I see animals, men, women, children on a beach. I see what looks like a pelican. There's a man carrying an umbrella. There's someone on a skateboard. There's someone riding a bicycle. There's a bull in the water. There's an upside down sailboat. There's also a car in the water, with a sea gull sitting on top of it. There's a fish with a horn blowing in a man's ear. There's a red light on the beach. There's someone being buried in sand.
