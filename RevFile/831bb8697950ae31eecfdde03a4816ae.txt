Well, this is quite an interesting beach scene. It's, uh, a very crowded beach with all kinds of, uh, people and animals, and, uh, uh, uh, there's a car driving on the water. There's a- a sailboat upside down. There's a guy with a surfboard that's made from a ruler. And, um, well, there's a bull also swimming in the water next to the guy with snorkel. And, uh, the beach, there's a lifeguard with, uh, tennis rackets on his feet, and a dog with a little life preserver around him. And- and it's hard to describe all the things I'm seeing here, but it looks like a fun place to be. But I think I'm a little too old for it, maybe.
