It is a sunny day at the beach. There are people, as well as several different animals at the beach. There is a lifeguard, who has tennis rackets as flip flops. He is sitting in a chair, looking at the ocean. There is a man riding a bike on the boardwalk, and there is a boy riding a skateboard on the boardwalk. There is a man being buried in the sand, and there are people and animals swimming in the water.
