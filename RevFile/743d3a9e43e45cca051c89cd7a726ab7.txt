This is a very happy scene of a very diverse and odd group of people. Everybody's smiling except for one man, who is being forced to listen to a fish play a trumpet. There are various farm animals around, upside down boats, crabs on stilts, lifeguard in snow shoes but you know, everybody's happy. It just looks like a happy place to be even though none of it actually makes sense.
