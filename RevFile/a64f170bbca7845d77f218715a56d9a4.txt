The image is very crowded. It's ve-, eh, very, um, dense and populated with several items and objects that are what people would expect at the beach, but also unusual and not very typical of a beach once you glance at it much closer. For example, you can see someone surfboarding with a giant ruler. You can also see in, in the ocean, a person seeing a fish playing the trombone, so it's very hectic, very crowded and overall, I think, unusual and something that's not very typical despite the beach setting. The looking typical at, uh, at an initial glance.
I'd say the mo-, the overall mood is positive. It seems that despite the unusualness of the si-, situations and the people and the objects at the beach, most of the people seem to be content, happy, enjoying themselves; and I think that so-, sort of also is impacted, impacts the reader. I mean, the viewer. If not, then I'd say just the familiar setting of a beach is very positive towards people, and many people see beaches as positive things, something that they are interested in and enjoy going to, to interact with peo-, other people, to swim in the oceans, or just to have fun with friends in various activities that is possible at a beach.
