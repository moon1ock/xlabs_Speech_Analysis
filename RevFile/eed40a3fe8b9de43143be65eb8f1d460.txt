Then a traffic indicator, was on the beach sand. And I see some people also swimming in the beach.

And I see somebody on a skateboard, wearing a yellow cloth. And somebody having a big umbrella. They're standing beside a dock. I see... I see, uh, somebody, uh, wearing a pink. And it's sunny, on a bright day. And I see somebody floating, riding a measuring tape, like a ruler, right across the beach. And I see another red bird, flying around the beach.
