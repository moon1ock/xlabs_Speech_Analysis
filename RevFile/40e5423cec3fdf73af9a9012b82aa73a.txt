This looks like it's a really happy, exciting picture. Um, it seems like everyone is at the beach on a really sunny, bright day. Uh, I see a lot of people and some animals (laughs) playing in the ocean. Um, I see an upside down boat, and a car, a guy on top of a ruler. And I see a cow and a fish, a giant fish playing an instrument. Um, on the sand, there is a hunky lifeguard. Um, and I see a crab on stilt, and a dog. Um, and uh, a yellow and orange, um, inner tube? And um, some guy buried under the sand.
And on the boardwalk or the sidewalk, um, I see some people on... one guy is on a bicycle, another guy is on a skateboard. Um, basically, I would say that, you know, this picture is very comical. There were some things here that don't make sense. I see, um, a younger person holding an ice cream cone upside down. And I think, I mentioned earlier that there is a guy in an upside down boat in the ocean. But, you know, over all it's a very jovial scene. Most people look very happy, and very excited to be outside. Um, everyone just seems like they're enjoying a vacation or of a special holiday.
