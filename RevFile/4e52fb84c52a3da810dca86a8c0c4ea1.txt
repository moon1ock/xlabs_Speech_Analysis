I feel like the mood of this photo is really energetic, upbeat, and really fun. There's a lot going on, it's a busy day at the beach and there are things to do at every corner. There are also a lot unusual things, like you'll look into the ocean and see someone driving in the ocean, someone is using a ruler as a surfboard, it's just a lot of wacky, silly things going on, but a lot of fun to watch. The lifeguard is wearing rackets on his feet. There's a dog about to go swimming with raft around. And for some reason there is a traffic light in the middle of the sand, but overall it seems like people are having a lot of fun.
