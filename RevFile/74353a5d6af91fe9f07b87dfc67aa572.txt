I am looking at a cartoon picture of a beach. There are a lot of crazy things going on here. There's a lifeguard with some snow skis on, there's a dog with a ring inflatable around about to get into the water, there's another guy in the water who is surfing on what looks like a ruler. The sun is wearing sunglasses and there's a sailboat that is upside down. There's also a green car going across the water with some sort of bird on top.
