I'm looking at a picture of a cartoon scene. There's a bunch of cartoon characters at a beach. Um, kind of wacky scene. They got a guy that's, I guess, surfing on a ruler. There's a boat that's upside down in the water. There's a green car with a bird on top, and there looks to be a fish playing a horn. There's also a traffic light there too, and a guy trying to eat a cup- ice cream cone upside down. It's a pretty funny scene and kind of crazy.
