It's the weekend, it's Sunday, and everyone is on the beach. I see traffic light on the beach with a, a red, a yellow, and a green sign. We see cows that are able to come. See a whale that's playing the trumpet and disturbing the peace. And there's someone who's looking very disappointed. In this day and age, through it's the way animals and humans both come together and play together.
