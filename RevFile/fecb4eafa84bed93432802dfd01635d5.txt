Looks like a fun day at the beach. I see a lifeguard sitting on a yellow chair. Uh, next to him is a surfboard, a life preserver, and an oversized fork. That's quite interesting. I see a traffic light all along the shoreline. That certainly doesn't belong there. I see a sailboat at the top, upside down. That certainly isn't right. On the upper right-hand corner, I see a purplish, lavender-colored fish, playing a trumpet. Wow, interesting. 
In the upper left-hand corner is, is the sun wearing sunglasses. I've seen that before. Uh, I see, and again, in the upper left-hand corner, a surfer who is surfing on a, a, uh, measuring stick. (laughs) Interesting. Uh, I see lots of other people. See at the bottom, see a kid wearing, uh, a helmet, knee and elbow pads on a skateboard, uh, see somebody eating an ice cream cone. The ice cream cone's upside down. Interesting. Uh, I see a crab on stilts. Quite interesting as well. Uh, very comical. Very, very funny picture.
