The people who are in the pool, in the ocean, really don't quite understand that concept, but when they realize that everything is up and down and nothing seems to make sense, they get a- they get through it quite well. The lifeguard recognizes that birds can stop when they require to stop, that dogs can walk when they have to walk, and that sailboats are not just good for, uh, traveling, uh, with the, the bass on the water, but also for the top of the, uh, uh, top of the sail gliding along the, the waves.
