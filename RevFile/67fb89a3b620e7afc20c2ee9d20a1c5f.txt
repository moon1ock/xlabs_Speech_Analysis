Okay, so I see sort of, like, a chaotic, um, beach scene. It's- it's, like, a cartoon beach scene. It reminds me a bit of, like, Where's Waldo books, or something like that. Um, it's, yeah, I mean, it's like a- a cartoonish beach scene with, you know, a- a sun that's got sun glasses and a smile, so, like, various personified animals are participating. There's a lot of absurd, surreal stuff going on, like a man driving a- a car on the water, or a person sailing a boat upside-down. Um, there's, like, a- a- a... yeah, lot's of absurd stuff. A crab on crutches, um, there's a boy who is carrying his ice cream cone upside-down, um, a fish playing trumpet. Um, so yeah, that's how I would describe it, as a chaotic, absurd, uh, beach scene.
