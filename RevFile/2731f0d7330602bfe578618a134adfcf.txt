There is a lot going on in the ocean while the lifeguard is not even paying attention. His stool is made of a fork and he is wearing tennis rackets for sleepers. On the beach, it is also equally crowded and crazy. There're animals, and there are also running children, as well as someone being buried in the sand. The street and boardwalk by the beach is also being used by bicyclists and skateboarders. Everything is hectic here.
