It's a beautiful beach scene where... It's, it's just exactly like, uh, my Florida beach where people (laughs) all used to swim. They like to ski. Always the weather is, is really, really sunny. Yes. Here in the, uh, picture it has... People are skiing. The animals are, uh, enjoying the, uh, nice, sunny weather and they are bathing in the water. Uh, some people are swimming and one guy is driving their car. And one, um, goose is sitting on top of it, one dog. And people are biking and, um, some- someone is skiing. Some duck is coming over there and people are collecting ice creams. It's, it's pretty, beautiful beach scene which everyday I am seeing that, uh, next to my home in Florida. What a pleasant, pleasant view and a great image, it is.
