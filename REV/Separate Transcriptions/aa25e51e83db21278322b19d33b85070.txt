I see a very happy place on the ocean. It could be California, it could be Florida. I see many people enjoying, uh, the setting, the boom looks happy, uh, including the animals, the birds, the dogs, the humans. I see lots of ice cream, some of it upside down, which is interesting. I see a stoplight, which I'm not sure why the stoplight or the fork is there. But a very interesting scene, big scene, uh, including a boat that's backwards. I enjoyed reading.
