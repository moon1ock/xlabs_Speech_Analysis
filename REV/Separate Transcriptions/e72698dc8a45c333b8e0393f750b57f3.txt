The scene is somewhat crazy. There is a man in the ocean who's surfing on a board that looks like a ruler. There's also a car going across the ocean, and it seems like it's very awkward, and people are just ... Well, no, not really even realizing that this is a strange situation. There is a bird and a stoplight right on the sand and a cow floating in the ocean. I see people looking but not really seeming to be confused.
