I see the beach with the sun shining brightly. I see a man, looks like he's on a ruler, surfing. I see a bull in the water, a green car with a bird on top of it, people playing in the water, a lifeguard sitting in a chair. I see a red lobster. I see a fork. I see a lifesaver. I see a puppy dog with a floatie on. I see a red, yellow, green light. I see somebody with a ice cream cone upside down. I see someone riding a red bicycle. I see a man headed to the beach, carrying a yellow and brown bag, with a red and white umbrella. I see someone skateboarding on the sidewalk. I see a white... looks like a pelican, in the sand. Everyone seems to be enjoying their day on the beach.
