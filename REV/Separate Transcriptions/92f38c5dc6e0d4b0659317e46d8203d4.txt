In this picture, it looks like there's a bunch of people having fun. They're all at the beach, entertaining themselves in some type of way. There are even animals in the pictures with the people, who seem to be interacting together, also. I see animals playing instruments, and it just looks like a cool, fun, summer-time day. I would love to go and be a part of this period, yeah.
