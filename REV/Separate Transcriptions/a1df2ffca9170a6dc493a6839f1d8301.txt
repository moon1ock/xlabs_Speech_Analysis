I see it is a nice summer day. People are at the beach, All kinds of people. There's all kinds of things in the water, things that would not be in the water. And on the beach, there are things like a streetlight and a dog wearing a floatie. I see a man riding a wave on a ruler, a boat upside down, and a cow in the water.
