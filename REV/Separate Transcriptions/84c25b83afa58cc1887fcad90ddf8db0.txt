The image is a beach scene, taking place on a very sunny day, with clear blue skies, with only a few cumulus clouds in the sky. The water is a bright green color, and there are many people swimming, boogie boarding and wading in the water. On the sand there are people laying down with an umbrella, a man being buried in the sand, a lifeguard on duty sitting on his chair, watching everyone in the water, and other revelers. There is also a boardwalk on which a young skateboarder wearing a helmet is riding. Behind them there is another young boy riding a bicycle. The beach is very crowded, and for some strange reason, there is a red yellow green traffic light on the sand. I do not know the purpose of this. However, the scene is very pleasant and everyone seems to be getting along fine.
