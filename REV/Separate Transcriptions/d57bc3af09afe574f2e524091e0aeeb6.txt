Okay. So, this is a cartoon image on ... It kinda reminds me almost of like a Where's Waldo cartoon, or or picture. It's a beach scene, it's sort of very chaotic, there's all sorts of crazy kind of surreal stuff going on. Um, there's, you know, there's sort of anthropomorphized animals walking around. There's a crab on crutches for some reason. Um, there's a man surfing in the ocean but he's using a ruler as a surfboard. 
There's somebody driving a car on the ocean, there's a sailboat upside-down. Uh, there's an anthropomorphized sun with sunglasses, there's a fish playing a trumpet. There's a boy carrying a ice cream cone upside-down. Um, and and then funny enough, there's also other uh sort of characters who are just kind of normal. There's a guy riding a bike. There's a kid riding a skateboard. There's a man carrying a beach umbrella and a cooler. Uh, you know, there's there's a few sort of sea birds um sitting on the sand, or on a on a fence, kind of just acting as you'd expect. So it's sort of normal aspects of a beach scene, uh kind of mixed in with strange, uh surreal, unrealistic elements at the same time.
