This is an unusual picture of what at first appears to be a happy beach scene, but upon further examination, is a collection of objects that both belong in the beach scene and do not. Um..The emotional setting looks fairly happy and positive. Everybody appears to be having a good time, even if they're doing things that are illogical. It's a sunny day, the sun is shining, and he's got a smile on his face, although the sun doesn't have a face. And all but uh.. couple of the characters, looks like only one of the characters has what appears to be a frown. Everybody else or everything else is smiling. So, I would say the mood and emotional setting is positive and fun.
