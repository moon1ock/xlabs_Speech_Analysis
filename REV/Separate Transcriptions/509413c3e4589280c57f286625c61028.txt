So I'm looking at a picture of happy people. There's happy people, there's animals that look happy, everyone's smiling, you know, it's a day at the beach. Got car driving on the water, upside-down sail boat, you know, there's a red bird flying, people with umbrellas, skateboarders, you know, it's all very nice. The sun has some sunglasses on, it's a very nice day. And as you could say, it's a very happy day, people really en- are enjoying how nice it is.
