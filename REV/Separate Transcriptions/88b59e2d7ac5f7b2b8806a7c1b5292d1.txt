There is a lot happening in this picture. There are a lot of people at the beach, it doesn't seem like it's factual because there's a dog walking on two feet, the crab is just sitting in a chair. There is a lifeguard but his shoes are tennis rackets, so this picture is very just imaginative, like it's meant for a kids' book, so it's not realistic. There is a kid eating an ice cream cone upside down which caught my attention. There's a traffic light in the middle of the picture as well. Um, some normal things, there is a guy riding a bike, there's a guy skateboard, um... there's some people swimming. Uh, the boat is upside down so that's different. Uh, there's a car in the water, the sun has sunglasses. Interesting. But yeah.
