This is a fun, kind of frivolous, uh, cartoon of, ah, things that go on at the beach. Some of it is- is sort of, uh, fanciful. Ah, like there's a dog with a- with a little life preserver around it's, uh, waste, and there's a, a cow out in the- in the water, and also a car out in the water, driving in the water, and an- and an upside down boat. Uh, but most, and there are... mostly it's just, uh, a lot of, uh, kind of cartoon people having a good time at the beach. They're- they've got, uh, umbrellas and, uh, scuba gear and things like that, and they're- and they're just swimming and frolicking and, and burying each other in the sand, and- and it's- it's a, it's something you might see in a- in a children's book. Um, it's- it's just kind of an- kind of an upbeat sort of, uh, fun day at the beach picture.
