Okay. This is an image of many things. It seems like it's pretty crazy and hectic. So first off, we're at a beach. Um, there's people here plus animals enjoying the beach. There's (laughing) many different animals actually such as cows, seagulls, um, fish, you know, everything, and it looks like they're all getting along with the humans. Um, it's really crowded and there's a lot going on. Like some things don't make sense like the stoplight, or the cow just swimming, or the guy upside down on the boat. Uh, it seems like a nice and bright sunny day though so everyone's enjoying their time and having a good day at the beach. There's a lot of colors going on, and yeah, like I said, it's just a little bit confusing, but it's funny at the same time. I think this is what the beach would look like if humans and animals got along like this.
