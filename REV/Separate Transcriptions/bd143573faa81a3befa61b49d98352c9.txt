It is a wonderful beach day here in the picture. It's a really happy and a colorful picture that I am looking at. There's a lifeguard and there's some seagulls and for some odd reason there is a cow in the beach. And there's a fish with a trumpet and a car in the ocean and a boat which is upside down. It's a funky looking picture, it's really happy. I really like the, the crab with the crutches, and the, and the, and, and the, and the little kid with the ice-cream upside down. Overall this picture is really happy and it reminds me of summer.
