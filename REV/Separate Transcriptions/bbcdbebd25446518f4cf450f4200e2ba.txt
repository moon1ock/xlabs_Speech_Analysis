I see a sun. I see boat upside down. I see a dude skiing on a skiing board. I see a cow swimming, a snorkeler. A fish is singing. People are swimming. I see a dog with a floaty, a person with an upside down snow cone. I see different birds everywhere. I see people on bicycles. I see a crab walking on crutches and I see a man buried in the sand.
