In the picture, there's a really crowded beach. On the sand, there are a bunch of people. There's a lady in a pink swimsuit, bending over. There's a lifeguard who's wearing what it look like snow shoes. There's a crab on a pair of stilts. There's a guy holding an ice cream cone upside down, but the ice cream isn't falling off the cone. There's a wall separating the sand from a kind of a boardwalk, and there's a man on a bicycle and a younger person on a skateboard. 
Out in the water, there's a fish blowing a horn, a pink fish. There's a green car (laughs) driving over the water, which is (laughs) ... and a, and a seagull wearing what look like green shorts, standing on top of the green car. There's a sailboat, but it's upside down. The sail is in the water, and the boat part is up in the air. There's a guy surfboarding on what looks like a giant ruler. There's a cow smiling and swimming. Um, the s-, there's a sun in the sky, and it's wearing sunglasses.
And there on the distance, there's a, like a little hill with two palm trees and a, what, there's a blue building, which I would assume would be a hotel or something. Uh, the picture, I'm assuming, is supposed to ver- it's kind of funny (laughs) 'cause you're looking at it, and there's all kinds of goofy things, like there's a dog with a, with a, with a swim ring around his waist. He's gonna be wa-, he's walking into the water, and um, it's a funny picture.
