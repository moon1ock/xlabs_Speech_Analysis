This is an image of people and animals on a beach. Um, it, everybody seems to be happy, having a good time out in the sun. There are people playing in the sand, there is a skate boarder, a bicyclist, a cow in the ocean (laughs), a fish playing a musical instrument, the sun is up in the corner and it is wearing sun shades. There is a man in a speed boat completely upside down. Um, one of the legs of where the lifeguard is sitting, the stand is actually a fork into the ground. And there is a crab on stilts. Many things going on. There is a traffic light embedded in the sand. There are birds, there is a bird on a car which is on top of the water in the ocean. There is a dog about to get into the water with his little inner-tube so he doesn't drown. And it just looks like everyone's having a grand old time on the beach out in the sun.
