The mood and the emotional setting of the picture looks very fun, very carefree, free spirited, vibrant. There are people at a beach, doing typical beach things, only there's definitely something odd going on, because there are people driving on water, there are cows in water. There is a man on the surfboard, that really looks like a ruler. But all in all, it looks like a happy, bright time, where people are playing, having fun, and getting along with each other, even though things definitely seem to be backwards and upside down.
