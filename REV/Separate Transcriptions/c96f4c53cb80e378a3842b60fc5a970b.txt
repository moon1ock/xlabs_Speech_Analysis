I'm looking at a colorful beach scene and it's surrealist and kind of absurdist. It reminds me of those highlights where you have to find certain drawing and sketch, including a car being driven on the water, a cow swimming in the water, some guy surfing on a ruler, and an upside down boat. There's also a fish playing a trumpet, um, and people doing really bizarre things on the beach as well. I would need far more than five or six sentences to describe what I'm looking at here.
