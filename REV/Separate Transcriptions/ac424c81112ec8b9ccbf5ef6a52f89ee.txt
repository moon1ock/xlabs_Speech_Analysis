People are at the beach and they all seem very relaxed and happy. There's a man who is buried in the sand with his head up. There're animals flying around a stop sign and a cow in the ocean. There is a fish playing a horn behind a man. There's an old woman and what looks to be her grandson in the water. Everyone seems happy, relaxed, and none of the things that are unusual, for example, a cow in the water or a crab on stilts seems to bother anyone.
