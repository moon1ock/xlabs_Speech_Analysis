It's the weekend, it's Sunday, and everyone is on the beach. I see a traffic light on the beach with a, uh, a red, a yellow, and a green sign. We see cows that have also come. See a whale that's blowing the trumpet and disturbing the peace, and there's someone who's looking very, uh, disappointed. In this day and age, who- it's the way animals and humans both come together and play together.
