This is a beach scene. M- it's a rather crowded beach. Many people are on it or approaching it. There are also some folks skateboarding and riding bicycles on the boardwalk uh, behind it. Some of the activities being undertaken are being buried in the sand, surfing on a ruler it would appear, uh, boating upside down, driving a car on the water. Uh, there is also an ox in the water and a dog in an inflatable. A crab on some stilts. Uh, and for some reason a stop light right in the middle of the sand. Most of the other people on the picture seem to be doing more or less normal expected things at the beach. The lifeguard, however, is sitting in his tower chair, one leg of it made of a fork. And he appears to be wearing tennis rackets as flip flops. A little bit silly.
