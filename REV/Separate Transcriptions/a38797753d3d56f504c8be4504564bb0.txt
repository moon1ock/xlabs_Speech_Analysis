This is such a busy image, I hardly know where to start. It's a beach scene with a lifeguard presiding over the beach, um, there are people on skateboards, bicycles, people swimming in the water and yes, there's even a cow swimming in there. Um, I can see, um, people scuba diving, splashing about, having a good time, um, a man being buried in the sand and there's even a fork, stuck in the sand next to the lifeguard chair. Um, it's rather comic or done in cartoon fashion, uh, and I have a smile on my face as I describe it and, oh yes, there's actually a stop sign on the beach too, uh, a stop light on the beach.
